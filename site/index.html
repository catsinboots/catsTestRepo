It’s never too late to fix your life 
A Jordan Peterson video on YouTube 
As I embarked on the journey to bring my life back together., I found Jordan peterson.
He was one of the most influential people I “discovered”as his teachings and ideas resonated with me on a level I didn’t know was possible in the sense that I did;nt know I was capable of. I felt so lost in life and came so close to suicide. I am grateful to have found this individual as he helped me find meaning in the past and still is helping me in this journey.
This essay is about one of the numerous videos I watched about this individual. And one that I recommend everyone to watch as an introduction to this individual. The video I’m talking about is actually very vaguely put together but it’s an amazing introduction to what this person has to offer

This person helped me face myself and look at what I am. How broken I really am and how much work I Really need to put on myself. Modern society does not acknowledge broken individuals. They say things like you’re fine, You’ll get over it no problemo. Although this is with good intention they do not acknowledge how broken really the individual is. they put a bandage on a wound that requires a surgery. This is led/is leading to the failure of an entire generation. Specifically, My generation. I absolutely recommend this anyone feeling lost/left behind to check out this person’s videos to get clarity on why you are so and how to start fixing things.

It’s never too late to start fixing thing. Sure you’ve heard this a lot before. So have I. This Quote sure does give you Hope. But in the end of the day, It is still just a Quote. It does not give much to work with. In fact the only thing that this Quote gives is Hope. There’s no lack of Hope. In fact Many other Videos with the same title only give you hope and certain vague instructions on how to live your life. These are the same thing you’ve probably head many number of times in the past and won’t do much in terms of actually helping you.You can turn to Your neighbour and he’ll give you hope (This actually happened in my life). This video However gives you much more than Hope. It give you the actual direction you have to follow to actually reach your goals. This might look too good to be true - one YouTube video to fix my life?. But I promise you it is not. Here’s Why, He tells stories but he tailors those stories so well that it actually tells you what to do. There’s a lot of reading between the lines but any person with an average IQ can figure out its intentions.

The video starts out with Jordan Peterson talking about his Situation.  He talks about his shortcomings and his achievements he made at that point of his life. This itself is a great confidence booster as it gives you hope that you can achieve your wildest dreams even though you are at a low point. Everything is difficult of you’re at a point of in your life where you don’t feel a 100% but this shows that 100% isn’t a prerequisite to grow, This was something holding me back from making progress. But this is the only way to escape the vicious cycle.\
The second part of this video starts with him quoting “You’re actually tougher than you think. Which is a perfect continuation to the previous part. Again, tailored so well !. He continues with “people play a role in their own demise” this as cynical as it sounds, is a good thing .It puts power in the person’s hand, Tells you that You are responsible for your situaltion and you are the only one that can fix it. It follows with him saying you didn’t learn this ways to deal with your situation in tour childhood for you depended on someone else to fix your situation. He says that you can fix this by yourself now or you can repent for it later in life.
First actionable resolution : He says you can fix your situation by making a list of what you’re afraid of. Then pick the thing you’re leas afraid of and work on it. He goes on in an elobarate way on how you can fix it. It is only here where you can use the quote “Slow and steady”. Fixing the thing takes time and there are processes which you can use to go about it. Nowhere else “slow and steady” can be used as too slow will screw your goals up.
“You can withstand the threat of death” that’s what going slow teaches you. Although this may not be a famous quote, I believe that this should be followed up with “go slow and steady”.
Second actionable resolution : “You can never be certain of achieving your goals, You can only be certain of the path you take”. This quote sums up the Second resolution. It can also be said with another popular quote “ The journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step”. Of you’re indecisive of your goals, put up constraints that helps you put your “path” first and try not to lurk into muddy waters. Ofcourse you’re gonna slip up, That’s human nature, but try to get back as soon as possible. In conclotion, the second actionable is to put up constrains. Think about constraints and put them up!.
Third resolution : Fix the things that are in need of repair!. These are small things in your sphere of influence. This helps you differentiate chaos from order. For example, clean up your room!
“Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, Not to someone else who is today” because this majorly comes in the way of action, You’d say to yourself “Well I would, BUT..”there are abundant reasons you can put in that sentence. But (whatever, millions of reasons).   </title>
